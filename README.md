# NPD AI Video Factory

NPD AI Video Factory is a data-driven video production system for Vietnamese real-estate content.

## Sprint 1 goal

Deliver one end-to-end 45-second vertical video through this path:

`n8n -> FastAPI -> script/storyboard -> TTS -> local footage -> video manifest -> Remotion -> final.mp4`

Sprint 1 deliberately excludes scene intelligence, ComfyUI, and automatic social publishing.

## Current implementation checkpoint

Sprint 1 Tasks 1-13 are implemented and covered by Docker Compose E2E:

- FastAPI health, readiness, create-job, status, and safe artifact endpoints
- Redis-backed job records, idempotency, queue, monotonic stage/progress transitions, and artifact registration
- provider interfaces for structured content generation and Vietnamese TTS
- deterministic development content provider
- deterministic local asset resolver with minimum-asset validation
- video-manifest builder and Draft 2020-12 JSON Schema validation
- API, worker, renderer, QC and Docker Compose E2E tests executed by GitHub Actions

The separate Agent Hub workstream has completed production Phase 5 and now includes
Phase 5.1 deterministic business-answer evals plus Phase 6 read-only multi-source
adapter contracts. External Ads/GA4/social sources remain unconfigured until dedicated
least-privilege credentials are accepted.

Phase 6B adds an attribution-ready Campaign Operating System on a stacked draft
branch: unified campaign IDs, lifecycle/RBAC/approval boundaries, channel planning,
specialist agents and a responsive Campaign Workspace. It is deliberately limited to
research, plan, draft and preview; production writes remain disabled.

## Intended local layout

apps/api/                    FastAPI HTTP service
services/worker/             Redis-backed pipeline worker
renderer/                    Remotion renderer and template
packages/contracts/          Cross-service JSON contracts
workflows/n8n/               Inactive importable workflows
storage/assets/              Local Sprint 1 footage
storage/jobs/                Generated job artifacts
```

The Docker Compose file is the runtime contract for the implementation.
